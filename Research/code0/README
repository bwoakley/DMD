A brief description of the subroutines for the channel flow version of diablo
Written by Thomas Bewley and John Taylor

diablo.f        Main program, define grid, read/write flow, statistics
input.dat       Set the desired flow parameters
fft.f           Wrapper for calls to FFTW
fft_ifort.f     Version of fft.f for the intel fortran compiler
fft_g77.f       Version of fft.f for the gnu fortran compiler
grid_def        Define the dimensions of the grid
header          Defines all variables and common blocks

periodic.f      Periodic (spectral) in all three directions (done)
channel.f       Periodic (spectral) in x and z, FD in y (done)
duct.f          Periodic (spectral) in x, FD in z and y (not done)
cavity.f        FD in x, y, and z (not done)


In order to run a new case do the following steps:
1.  Create a new case directory
2.  Copy grid_def and input.dat from an existing case directory and edit them as desired
3.  In the diablo/pre_process directory run create_grid_*.m in matlab or octave to create a new grid for each direction using finite differences (non periodic) and move the created *grid.txt files to the new case directory.
4.  If channel flow open diablo/channel.f and edit the create_flow_chan subroutine to have the desired initial conditions.
5.  Edit the script diablo/go by setting the rundir equal to the new case directory.
6.  Execute diablo by ./go from the diablo/ directory.
 (Note, If you have just changed the size of the grid in grid_def,
  the makefile may not recognize the change and recomplie.  If you get
  an error in the grid dimensions, type "./make clean" and then re-run "./go"
7.  Some post processing routines can be found in the post_processing directory along with descriptions on their use.

In finite difference (wall bounded) directions, the grid is defined as follows:
(Here the y-direction will be shown, but others should be treated the same)
The points outside the domain are ghost cells and are used to apply the desired boundary conditions.  In the case of one wall-bounded direction, the X and Z velocities (U1 and U3) are defined at the GYF points along with the pressure.  Vertical velocity (U2) is defined at GY points. The GYF points are by definition located halfway between neighboring GY points.

      
 GYF(NY+1)         ---     
                    *            GY(NY+1)
 GYF(NY)      -----Wall-----   
                    *            GY(NY)
 GYF(NY-1)         ---
                    *            GY(NY-1) 
 GYF(NY-2)         --- 
  


 GYF(j+1)          ---
                    *            GY(j+1)
 GYF(j)            ---
                    *            GY(j)
 GYF(j-1)          ---
                    *            GY(j-1)



 GYF(2)            ---
                    *            GY(2)
 GYF(1)      -----Wall-----
                    *            GY(1)
 GYF(0)            ---
