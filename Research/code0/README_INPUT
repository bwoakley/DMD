This file describes the parameters used in Diablo and contained in input.dat

NU:
The viscosity in code units.  If the code has been nondimensionalized, then this constant becomes 1/Re where Re is the Reynolds number using the selected velocity and length scale.

LX,LY,LZ:
The domain size

N_TIME_STEPS:
Number of integration time steps.  Each timestep contains three Runge-Kutta substeps.

DELTA_T:
The size of the timestep

RESET_TIME:
If true, then the simulation time will start at zero, if false, then the simulation will start using the time contained in the initial velocity field (if CREATE_NEW_FLOW=false)

VARIABLE_DT, CFL, UPDATE_DT:
If VARIABLE_DT=true then the CFL number will be used to specify the timestep every UPDATE_DT timesteps

NUM_PER_DIR:
The number of periodic directions. This determines which timestepping algorithm will be used:
   3=periodic flow, 2=channel flow, 1=duct flow, 0=cavity flow

TIME_AD_METH:
Allows a choice of timestepping method

LES:
If true, then solve the LES filtered equations with the addition of a LES model

LES_MODEL_TYPE:
Specifies the method used for the LES model
  1=Constant Smagorinsky, 2=Dynamic Smagorinsky, 3=Dynamic mixed model

VERBOSITY:
How much information to write out, higher=more information

SAVE_FLOW_INT:
How often (in timesteps) to save the entire 3d velocity field to a file

SAVE_STATS_INT:
How often to write mean statistics to a file

MOVIE:
If true, then write out 2d slices through the velocity field every SAVE_STATS_INT timesteps in order to create movie files

CREATE_NEW_FLOW:
If true, then initialize the velocity field using the CREATE_FLOW subroutines, if false, then initialize the velocity field from a restart file called diablo.saved

IC_TYPE, KICK:
Specify the type of initial condition used in CREATE_FLOW, and add random forcing of KICK amplitude.

F_TYPE, UBULK0, PX0, OMEGA0, AMP_OMEGA0:
  F_TYPE=1 force with a constant pressure gradient PX0
  F_TYPE=0 use a pressure gradient that keeps the bulk velocity constant UBULK0
  F_TYPE=2 force with an oscillatory pressure gradient, amplidude AMP_OMEGA0, frequency OMEAG0

U_BC_LOWER, U_BC_LOWER_C1, etc.
Type of boundary condition used for the x-velocity at the lower wall
  U_BC_LOWER = 0 Apply Dirichlet boundary conditions, set the x-velocity at the boundary to U_BC_LOWER_C1
  U_BC_LOWER = 1 Apply Neumann boundary conditions, set the wall-normal gradient of the x-velocity equal to U_BC_LOWER_C1

Note, for duct and cavity flow, boundary conditions for the side walls should be added to the input file.
