%%%%%To make a new flow:

When changing cases, there are 3-5 places to update:
-1) Editing diablo.f
O) In input.dat when chosing case.
1) When copying to Case/name, (2 changes, see below).
2) When extracting, in res_to_dat, (1 change).
3) When post processing, in Matlab code (1 change).
	

If edited diablo.f, inside code0:
	rm -f diablo; rm *.o; make;
Produce data inside case1:
	rm -f diablo.saved*; rm -f diablo_th01*; rm -f pos*; rm -f Thi; ../diablo;
Copy data to Cases, from inside case1:
	cd ..; cd ..; cd Cases/; rm -f Lint/*; cd ..; cd code0/; cp -a case1/. ../Cases/Lint/
Extract. If choosing new folder in Cases, edit res_to_dat to find.
If edited res_to_dat, inside extract:
	rm res_to_dat; make; ./res_to_dat;

%%%%%If gedit gets stuck on `Failed to register: Timeout was reached'
Then do:
killall gedit

%%%%%When done on server:
	
git add .  %don't need this line every time, only when adding new file.
git commit -a -m 'Your message here:'
git push origin main

git pull https://gitlab.com/boakley/mixingandlyapexp.git
	
	
%%%%%Changing grid:

I tried changing grid from 256->512
I changed grid_def that was in: case1, code0, and extract.
In code0 README it said to do ./make clean, so I did from within code0:
make clean
This responded rm -f *.o fort.* *~ diablo core
I noticed it removed files ending in ~, that is:
diablo.f~
diablo_io.f~
header~
periodic.f~
Then I execute:
make
This created file: diablo, but not the other ~ files. hmmm...
And diablo still doesn't run
