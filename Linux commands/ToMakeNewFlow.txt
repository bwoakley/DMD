To make a new flow:

Go to folder code0:
Change flavor in case1/input.dat
rm old files in case1
../diablo
will save data in case1

Go to folder Cases:
mkdir in Cases to save data

Go to case0:
copy data from case1 to Cases/name using the following command (from inside case0)
cp -a case1/. ../Cases/name/

Go to folder extract:
edit res_to_dat.f to find new folder Cases/name
rm res_to_dat executible 
make while in extract
./res_to_dat executible
data should be in Cases/name


If you mess up, you will override your previous files in Cases/OldName   !
Question: Can I get the data to automatically place in Cases/name instead of copying all from case1?

Use semicolon ; to chain multiple commands

Can we use command line to copy the files?

git add .
git commit -m 'Add README.md file by hakase-labs'
